# Reflection

Using AI agents (Copilot and ChatGPT) sped up architecture and documentation tasks significantly under this tight deadline. The agents provided scaffolding, domain model drafts, and README/AGENT_WORKFLOW templates which I then validated manually.

Learnings:
- AI saves time for boilerplate and doc generation.
- Domain logic (CB computations, banking/pooling rules) must be manually validated against the regulation text.

Improvements for next time:
- Add automated unit tests generated and validated by agents.
- Fully implement backend endpoints and frontend integration.

Overall, using AI allowed me to deliver a clean, well-structured minimal submission within the deadline.
